# Dropnote

## Introduction

[Dropnote](http://dropnote.today) - your personal coffee brewings diary.

Available in AppStore: #URL#

## Why is it public repo?

There are a few reasons. The main one is sharing knowledge and opinions.

I'd like to learn throught discussions, open issues and code/design changes.
I hope that it may also be a learning opportunity or interesting experience for others.

If you want to know more about code base, its design and used patterns (or made mistakes) take a look at [app design page](APPDESIGN.md).

## Installation

- Clone the repo to working directory
- Dependencies are managed with [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org), so you have to run:
```
pod install
```
If you don't have CocoaPods installed, run:
```
[sudo] gem install cocoapods
```
- Open the `Brewer.xcworkspace` in Xcode:  
```
open Brewer.xcworkspace
```

### What does _Brewer_ name refer to?

_Brewer_ is the initial name (current code name) of the project. _Dropnote_ was made up much later.

## Planned features

List of features to be implemented in near future.

- iCloud synchronization
- Interactive timer in _time_ step
- Better UX in score details

## Contributing

Honestly, I don't expect any contribution because it's personal project (but I'll appreciate it, anyway).

However, I'd love to hear feedback about code design or have some discussions about used solutions.
